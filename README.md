## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

In addition to the Anaconda distribution of Python, lightgbm and folium libraraies needs to be installed.
Use below commands to install these two libraries.

conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm 

pip install folium

Once the installations are done, the code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, we tried to understand how Airbnb is being used in Seattle through below questions:.

*  What are the busiest times of the year when you visit Seattle?
*  What are the neighborhoods with the highest no of listings?Where is it the most and least expensive to stay, on average?
*  What is the relationship between popularity of a listing and it's price?
*  What are some properties of the listings that can be used to predict price?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a single notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There are two images containing legend info for the maps.
For purposes of simplicity, these images were created separately and the related code is out of scope of this project.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@samardolui/what-data-tells-us-about-how-airbnb-is-being-used-in-seattle-b948a05b84b6).
